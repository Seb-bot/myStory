Once upon a time there were three little pigs and one day each of them made a house for themself.
The first pig made a house out of hay, The second pig made a house of wood, and the third one made a house out of brick.
Everyone was happy with their little houses until one day a big wolf came to the first piggy door and said "little little piggy let me in".
